## Current state of the development of a MPM-Preprocessor using Cocodrilo

Dec '22

The transient analysis of a cantilever beam under dead load has been validated with the .json and .mdpa files which can be found in the directories files_GID and files_Cocodrilo. The results for the Kratos input files from Cocodrilo are the same as the results for the files from GID. This can be seen in detail in the excel-file "Validation_results".

The static analysis of the cantilever example, which has been used for the validation of the transient analysis, was also validated. The details can be found in the excel-file "Validation_results". The respective GID-files can be generated by changing the analysis type in GID to "static" and writing the calculation files subsequently.



For more complex geometries, boundary conditions and other analyses no validation was conducted so far. Therefore, errors are likely to occur.
