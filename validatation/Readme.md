## Current state of the development of a MPM-Preprocessor using Cocodrilo

Dec '22

The transient analysis of a cantilever beam under dead load has been validated with the .json and .mdpa files which can be found in the directories files_GID and files_Cocodrilo. The results for the Kratos input files from Cocodrilo are the same as the results for the files from GID. This can be seen in detail in the excel-file "Validation_results".

Jan '22

The static analysis of the cantilever example, which has been used for the validation of the transient analysis, was also validated. The details can be found in the excel-file "Validation_results". The respective GID-files can be generated by changing the analysis type in GID to "static" and writing the calculation files subsequently.



For more complex geometries, boundary conditions and other analyses no validation was conducted so far. Therefore, errors are likely to occur. 

# Documentation: How to use Rhino/Grasshopper & Cocodrilo to generate simulation files for the KRATOS Multiphysics MPM Application

## Linear Analysis
This tutorial explains how to generate the computation files of a linear static analysis with the [KRATOS Multiphysics](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/wiki) [Particle Mechanics Application](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos/tree/master/applications/ParticleMechanicsApplication) and [Cocodrilo](https://github.com/CocodriloCAD/Cocodrilo), a plugin for Grasshopper/ Rhino. For that purpose a plate element (see Figure 1), clamped at one side, is modeled and analyzed with the material point method.

#### 1. General User Interface

The graphical user interface of Cocodrilo/Grasshopper/Rhino is depicted in Figure 2: 

<p align="center" width="100%">

    <br>
    <em>Figure 2: graphical user interface of Grasshopper; the tab of Cocodrilo is marked with the red rectangle.</em>
</p>

To see the menues *Analyses, DEM, Elements, Geometry, Materials, Models* and *Postprocessing* of Cocodrilo, click on the *Cocodrilo*-tab, as indicated by the red rectangle in Figure 2.

### 2. Define analysis method
To create a new model, set up a new, empty canvas in Grasshopper. For a MPM analysis, add the *Material point method* analysis field from the *Analyses*-menu (see Figure 3) to the canvas by clicking first on *MPM*, and then on the canvas.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="75%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51473791/221430285-af621478-7425-4302-b9d2-bc8d66afc1a1.png">

    <br>
    <em>Figure 4: MPM analysis field on the canvas of Grasshopper.</em>
</p>

For a linear, static analysis (LSA) of the cantilever, add a linear static analysis field in a next step from the *Analyses* menu (see Figure 5) to 
the current canvas (see Figure 6).

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="75%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51473791/221426370-610b969b-788d-434d-891a-4ffafd053a62.png">

</p>

When both fields (*MPM Analysis and LSA*) are present, connect them by drawing a line from "analysis" of the LSA field to "Analysis type" of the MPM analysis field, as shown in Figure 7.
Now the desired analysis fields are present on the canvas. In the next step we will add the geometry.

### 3. Generate clamped plate (body)

#### 3.1. Setup body geometry
The basis for setting up the geometry is the *Geo*-node within the *MPM*-field. Due to the internal data structure of *Cocodrilo*, a lot of information of the modelled problem is entered via the *Geo*-node: the input data from material parameters, boundary conditions and the body-mesh are entered via the *Geo*-node.

##### Cantilever beam
In order to model the cantilever beam, which is depicted in Figure 1, we have to add a *solid*-element (see Figure 8). However, this element is not an element in the sense of a finite-element, e.g. a plate element with 2 dofs at each corner, but rather an object in the sense of object-oriented-programming which has the mesh, the material and the thickness of the structure, which is to be modelled, as member variables. After adding the *solid*-element, a *MPM-Material*- as well as a *MPlane*-field have to be added. These are shown in Figures 9 and 10.
For the *MPlane*(=mesh plane)-field click on the tab *Mesh*.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="75%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51473791/221550075-c992e18d-27a5-4cc2-a193-49205816d817.png">

    <br>
    <em>Figure 10: Mesh-plane icon in the "primitives" tab of the "Mesh" tab.</em>
</p>

After adding the three new fields to the canvas, they have to be connected as shown in Figure 11:

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="75%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51473791/221551013-b48299e0-be5e-426a-bee3-9904fefad170.png">
    <br>
    <em>Figure 11: fields and connections required for the body element.</em>
</p>

To set the width and length of the beam, right click the *B*-node of the *MPlane* field. Then the subsequent depicted menu opens:

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51473791/221567498-e5cfb713-e7a0-46c1-825f-73c8a330cae0.png">
    <br>
    <em>Figure 12: menu to change parameters of the *MPlane* field</em>
</p>
Choose "Set one rectangle", as indicated by the red rectangle in Figure 12. Subsequently, the GUI of Rhino will appear where the dimensions of the cantilever beam can be entered (see Figure 13).

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="75%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51473791/221569196-23fdf884-f1d1-4a2e-9b56-940ca21382d2.png">
    <br>
    <em>Figure 13: Rhino GUI to enter the coordinates of the clamped plate.</em>
</p>
Add in the line, which is indicated by the red rectangle in Figure 13, the coordinates for the cantilever beam in the following way:

- Point 1: 0.0,0.5 
- Point 2: 1.5,0.5
- Point 3: 1.5,1.5

Finally, confirm the coordinates by hitting "enter" and the Grasshopper-canvas will appear again. If you click once a again on "Set one rectangle", you should see the following rectangle in Rhino (see Figure 14):

</p>

#### 3.2 Define the mesh
In this example we want to mesh the cantilever with a quadrilateral mesh. The edge lenghts of the elements should be 0.1m. For that purpose, right click the paramter *w* (=Width Count: Number of faces along x-direction) of the *MPlane* field and click "Set integer" of the appearing menu. Here, enter 15, as we have a cantilever with a length of 1.5m and with 15 elements in the x-direction, each element has length of 0.1m in the x-direction. Subsequently, set analogously *h* (=Height Count: Number of faces in y-direction) to 10.


#### 3.3 Define the material 
The material parameters for the steel plate can be entered in the *MPM Material* field. The default parameters of *MPM Material* field (see Figure 11) are the ones of steel.
The material nodes correspond to the following parameters:
- N: Name, e.g. Steel
- CL: Constitutive Law, e.g. LinearElasticIsotropicPlaneStrain2DLaw
- rho: Density
- E: Young's Modulous 
- nue: Poisson ratio
- c: Cohesion
- phi: Internal friction angle
- psi: Internal dilatancy angle
- n: Number of particles per element
- t: thickness of the element XXX Check which thickness is considered internallyXX!

As the default parameters are the parameters of the clamped plate of the example, only n, the number of particles per element, must be adapted. The default value of n is 3 (corresponding to a triangular mesh), but here a quadrilateral mesh is used. Therefore, we increase the number of particles per element increased to 4.

#### 3.4 Loads
The structure is only loaded by its dead load. This is considered automatically. Hence, no further steps to model the loads are necessary in this example.

### 4. Set up background domain
Although we haven't added any boundary conditions for the body domain yet, we will proceed with the background domain. The boundary conditions of the problem will be added in the last step, as they are imposed on the background mesh. For that purpose, of course, a background mesh has to be created beforehand. Therefore, we will continue with the background domain now. We start by adding a *FEM*-model field to the canvas (see Figure XX). You can find it in the *Models* tab of *Cocodrilo*. Moreover, add as previously shown, a mesh plane (*MPlane*) field for meshing the background domain to the canvas. Connect the *MPM*, *FEM* and *MPlane* fields as shown below in Figure 15.

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="80%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51473791/224546430-0432ddc0-15a1-4938-b733-99691c7a07ef.jpg">
    <br>
    <em>Figure 15: FEM-model and MPlane for background domain are present on canvas.</em>
</p>

To create a background domain and a background mesh, we proceed analogously as in Section [3.2](https://github.com/CocodriloCAD/Cocodrilo/blob/MPM_GH/validatation/Readme.md#32-definition-of--the-mesh). Firstly, we right click on the *MPlane* field and click afterwards *Set on rectangle* in the appearing menu (see Figure 12). Then the GUI of Rhino should appear (see Figure 13). Here we enter, as done previously, the coordinates of the rectangle that will be the background domain. We use the following values:

- Point 1: 0.0,0.0 
- Point 2: 2.0,0.0
- Point 3: 2.0,2.0

After entering the three points and confirming with "enter", the Rhino GUI will close again. If you reopen it (by clicking again on set on rectangle), the created rectangles should look as shown in Figure 16 in the topview:

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51473791/224571659-2ede6755-fa40-40b0-b6f1-aa4ba4c5ad4d.jpg">
    <br>
    <em>Figure 16: topview of the body and background rectangles</em>

</p>

To obtain a quadrilateral background mesh with elements with an edge length of 0.2 m, we have to set *W* (number of faces along x-direction) and *H* (number of faces along y-direction) to 10. Thus we created the background mesh.


### 5. Add boundary conditions on background mesh 
To add a boundary condition on the background grid, click on the support icon as shown in the Figure 17. Subsequently, add a support- and a curve-field to the canvas. A curve may be added the following way: double click on a free space on the canvas and write in the appearing line *crv*. Then a curve-field as shown in Figure 18 should appear.The orange color of the curve field (Figure 18) indicates that it is lacking input data. To add input data, right click *curve* and choose *Set one curve* (see Figure 19). 

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="50%" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51473791/224542007-1cfc054b-8490-45e1-953e-381f70252fe9.jpg">

    <br>
    <em>Figure 19: right-click menu of curve-field. To draw a curve choose "Set one Curve".</em>
</p>

Ensuilingly, the *Rhino* GUI appears (see Figure 20). To enter a curve, click first on the quadrilateral icon on the left to enter a polyline in Rhino. Then enter the following coordinates of the starting- an endpoint in the line marked by the rectangle above:

- Point 1: 0.0,0.4 
- Point 2: 0.0,1.65

After entering the coordinates of the starting and endpoint, hit enter to confirm the entered values. Then the Rhino GUI closes and the Grasshopper canvas appears again. So far only a curve, along which a boundary condition is enforced, was created. Now, this curve must also be chosen to be considered. For that purpose right-click again the *Curve*-field and choose *Set a Curve*. Now one can see, as shown in Figure XX, the curve which was created previously as a black line. Click on this black line to select it. Once the line has been selected, it changes its colour from black to green, as visible in Figure XX. Then the Rhino GUI closes again. Now, automatically a Dirichlet boundary condition will be created along this line and based on the mesh of the background grid.

### 6. Create KRATOS computation files
The clamped plate and its background domain has been modeled. Subsequently, we will create the following files which are required for a compuatation with the Particle Mechanics Application of KRATOS. These are:

- ProjectParameters.json
- ParticleMaterials.json
- Body.mdpa
- Grid.mdpa

We start by naming the analysis. For that purpose, right click on "Name" of the *MPM*-field (see Figure 11). Then select "Set Text" in the dropdown menu which opens subsequently. Enter here the name of your analysis; I use here "LSA_example".

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="50%" src="https://github.com/CocodriloCAD/Cocodrilo/assets/51473791/1cdd30d9-d78e-425b-b4a7-ed2f0fb1f72e">
    <br>
    <em>Figure 22: set the name of the analysis</em>
</p>

After setting the name of the analysis, set the value of "Run" of the *MPM*-field from *FALSE* to *TRUE* and do the same for "Run" of the *FEM* field. Thus, the calculation files for KRATOS are generated. At the moment, these are still difficult to find: Open the installation path of Cocodrilo and then under ...\Cocodrilo\Cocodrilo\Cocodrilo\bin\, you can find a folder with the name of the conducted analysis. In this case the name of the folder is "LSA_example". This folder contains the computation files for KRATOS, as shown in Figure 23.
