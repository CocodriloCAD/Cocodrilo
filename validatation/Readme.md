## Current state of the development of a MPM-Preprocessor using Cocodrilo

Dec '22

The transient analysis of a cantilever beam under dead load has been validated with the .json and .mdpa files which can be found in the directories files_GID and files_Cocodrilo. The results for the Kratos input files from Cocodrilo are the same as the results for the files from GID. This can be seen in detail in the excel-file "Validation_results".

For more complex geometries, boundary conditions and other analyses no validation has been conducted so far. Therefore, errors are likely to occur.
