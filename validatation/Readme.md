## Current state of the development of a MPM-Preprocessor using Cocodrilo

Dec '22

The transient analysis of a cantilever beam under dead load has been validated with the .json and .mdpa files which can be found in the directories files_GID and files_Cocodrilo. The results for the Kratos input files from Cocodrilo are the same as the results for the files from GID. This can be seen in detail in the excel-file "Validation_results".

The static analysis of the cantilever example, which has been used for the validation of the transient analysis, was also validated. The details can be found in the excel-file "Validation_results". The respective GID-files can be generated by changing the analysis type in GID to "static" and writing the calculation files subsequently.



For more complex geometries, boundary conditions and other analyses no validation was conducted so far. Therefore, errors are likely to occur. 

# Documentation: How to use Rhino/Grasshopper & Cocodrilo to generate simulation files for the KRATOS Multiphysics MPM Application

## Linear Analysis example
This how-to shows how to set up simulation files for a linear static analysis with the KRATOS Multiphysics (Link einfügen) MPM Application (Link einfügen) with Cocodrilo, a plug in for Grasshopper/ Rhino. For that purpose a cantilever beam is modeled and analyzed with MPM. The results of the analysis based on the *Cocodrilo* files are compared to the results of an analysis based on GiD (Link einfügen).

#### 1) General User Interface

The graphical user interface of Cocodrilo/Grasshopper/Rhino is depicted in the figure below:

To see the menues *Analyses, DEM, Elements, Geometry, Materials, Models and Postproessing* of Cocodrilo, click on *Cocodrilo* in  the line above, as indicated by the red rectangle. 

### 2) Define analysis method
To create a new model resp. analysis, set up a new, empty canvas in Grasshopper. For a MPM analysis, add the *Material point method* analyis from the *Analyses*-menu to the canvas by clicking on *MPM* firstly, and clicking on the canvas secondly.

For a linear, static analysis (LSA) of the cantilever, add a linear static analysis in a next step:

When both fields (*MPM Analysis and LSA*) are present, connect them with a line:

Now the desired analysis field is present on the canvas. In the next step we weill add the geometry.
