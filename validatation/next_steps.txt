Main file to modify: OutputKratosFem.cs

In this file the generation of the body mesh, background mesh, project parameters and material parameters 
file takes place.

Next steps for implementation:
- correct "name" of material laws
- dropdown menu for material laws -> modify for these purposes the file "Material_MPM_GH.cs"

- implement dropdown menu for supports to allow choosing of the slip condition in the support field -> modify for this purpose suport_GH.cs and property_support.cs
- rewrite WriteFEMmdpa function with using correct Grasshopper datastructure

- implement everything for 3D
